### 5.3 [Protocol Buffer](https://github.com/csirtgadgets/zic-protocol/blob/master/src/pb/zic.proto)

```
message Person {
  required string name  = 1;
  required int32 id     = 2;
  repeated string Email = 3;

  message PhoneNumberType {
      enum ptype_type {
        mobile  = 0;
        home    = 1;
        work    = 2;
    }
    required string text = 1;
    optional ptype_type ptype = 2 [ default = home ];
  }

  repeated PhoneNumberType PhoneNumber = 4;
}
```

6. Protocol
==
## 6.1 Person
The Person class is the top level class for stalking your loved ones. For each class, the semantics will be described and the relationship with other classes will be depicted with UML. 

```
+---------------+
| Person        |
+---------------+
| INT32 id      |<>----------[ Name           ]
|               |<>--{0..*}--[ PhoneNumber    ]
|               |<>--{0..*}--[ Email          ]
+---------------+
```

The aggregate class that constitute Person is:

### PhoneNumber
Zero or many. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's phone number.

### Name
Exactly One. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's name.

### Email
Zero or many. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's email address.

The Person class has one attribute:

### id
Required. INT32. A unique identifier representing the person.

## 6.2 PhoneNumber
The PhoneNumber class is all about storing meta-data, errr phone numbers about people in the Person class.

```
+------------------+
| PhoneNumber      |
+------------------+
| STRING           |
|                  |
| ENUM ptype       |
+------------------+
```

The PhoneNumber class has two attributes:

### number
Required. STRING. A free-form string representing the persons phone number.

### ptype
Optional. ENUM. This attribute indicates the type of phone number being represented by number.

1. **mobile**. A person's mobile number.
2. **home**. A person's home number.
3. **work**. A person's work number.

6. Data Types
==
Enumerated Types
--
Enumerated types are represented by the ENUM data type, and consist of an ordered list of acceptable values.  Each value has a representative keyword.  Within the schema, the enumerated type keywords are used as attribute values.
