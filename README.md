# 1. Goals

The Zic protocol is a magical protocol that enables you to track people's phone numbers, just like the government!

* To enable nerds to stalk their love interests
* To help you listen in on your loved-ones conversations more easily
* To re-invent the need for Facebook

# 5. Protocol
## Person Class
The Person class is the top level class for stalking your loved ones. For each class, the semantics will be described and the relationship with other classes will be depicted with UML. 

```
+---------------+
| Person        |
+---------------+
| REAL version  |<>----------[ Name           ]
| INT32 id      |<>--{0..*}--[ PhoneNumber    ]
|               |<>--{0..*}--[ Email          ]
|               |<>--
+---------------+
```

#####*The aggregate class that constitute Person is:*

### PhoneNumber
Zero or many. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's phone number.

### Name
Exactly One. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's name.

### Email
Zero or many. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's email address.

#####*The Person class has the following attributes:*

### version
Required. [REAL](#real-numbers). The specification version number to which this class conforms. While the protocol itself conforms to a [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), implemented, the protocol version should conform to a REAL (float/double) number using "tenths", to the right of the decimal as a placeholder. Examples:

Semver | REAL
-------|-------
```0.0.1```  | ```0.0010```
```1.0.01``` | ```1.0001```
```2.1.2```  | ```2.1020```
```0.01.01```| ```0.0101```

### id
Required. INT32. A unique identifier representing the person.

## PhoneNumber Class
The PhoneNumber class is all about storing meta-data, phone numbers about people in the Person class.

```
+------------------+
| PhoneNumber      |
+------------------+
| STRING           |
|                  |
| ENUM ptype       |
+------------------+
```

#####*The PhoneNumber class has two attributes:*

### number
Required. STRING. A free-form string representing the persons phone number.

### ptype
Optional. ENUM. This attribute indicates the type of phone number being represented by number.

1. **mobile**. A person's mobile number.
2. **home**. A person's home number.
3. **work**. A person's work number.

# 6. Examples
## XML

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<person version="0.0001" id="1">
    <name>Jimmybob</name>
    <email>jimmy@bob.com</email>
    <phonenumber ptype="mobile">+1 111-555-1212</phonenumber>
</person>
</xml>
```
## JSON

```
"Person": [{
    "@version": "0.0001",
    "@id": 1,
    "Name": "JimmyBob",
    "Email":["jimmy@bob.com"],
    "PhoneNumber": [
        {
             "#text": "+1 111-555-1212",
             "@ptype": "mobile"
        }
    ]
}]
```

# 7. Data Types
## Real Numbers

Real (floating-point) attributes are represented by the REAL data type. Real data MUST be encoded in Base 10.

## Enumerated Types

Enumerated types are represented by the ENUM data type, and consist of an ordered list of acceptable values.  Each value has a representative keyword.  Within the schema, the enumerated type keywords are used as attribute values.
