### 5.3 [Protocol Buffer](https://github.com/csirtgadgets/zic-protocol/blob/master/src/pb/main.proto)

```
message Person {
  required string name  = 1;
  required int32 id     = 2;
  repeated string Email = 3;

  message PhoneNumberType {
      enum ptype_type {
        mobile  = 0;
        home    = 1;
        work    = 2;
    }
    required string content = 1;
    optional ptype_type ptype = 2 [ default = home ];
  }

  repeated PhoneNumberType PhoneNumber = 4;
}
```

6. Protocol
==
## 6.1 Person
```
+---------------+
| Person        |
+---------------+
| INT32 id      |<>--------[ Name           ]
|               |<>--{0..*}[ PhoneNumber    ]
|               |<>--{0..*}[ Email          ]
+---------------+
```

The aggregate class that constitute Person is:

### PhoneNumber

### Name
Exactly One. STRING. A free-form string representing the person's name.

### Email

+------------------+
| STRING           |
|                  |

```

The PhoneNumber class has two attributes:

### number
